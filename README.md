# MockupCreator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## MockupCreator: How it works

This project allows you to create a MockUp for easier website creation. The main page of the creation tool consists of 3 main elements: The `Palette`, The `Canvas` and the `Component Properties`.

## Features

`Canvas` - as its name suggests, the canvas is where the elements of the `Palette` will be placed.

`Component Properties` - the user has the ability to change the component properties of the elements that are dragged inside the canvas, they can modify the `Component ID`, `value`, `dragability`, `class`, `CSS`, & `Style`. You can also find the `Position of the elements` (X & Y) under the `Properties Tab`. You can also remove the selected element inside the canvas by pressing the `Remove` button under the `Properties Tab`. 

In the `Code` tab, you have the different functionalities:

Copy: Copies the code generated by the tool in the user's clipboard.

Download: Downloads the HTML File of the Mockup.

Build: Opens a new tab that previews the Mockup.

`Palette` - Under the palette, we have 2 tabs which composes of the Elements and Templates. The elements are the components that can be dragged into the canvas. The Template is a ready-built page to guide the users in creation of their Mockup.

Elements:

`Navbar`: A navigation bar is a component of a website's user interface that contains links to other sections of the website.

`Link`: When you click on a Link, you can jump to a different location. A link can be an image or any other HTML element.

`Header`: A header is commonly used as a 'top section' of a web page.

`Paragraph`: A paragraph is a group of sentences that forms a specific topic.

`Label`: A label is a component used to define a caption for an element in an HTML

`Button`: A button is a component that is clickable. It can be used for various funcionality depending on the user.

`Dropdown`: When clicked, a drop-down menu drops down a menu that contains different options.

`Checkbox`: The check box is shown as a component that is ticked (checked) when activated.

`Radio Button`: The radio button is a control element that allows the user to select only one of a set of mutually excluseive possibilities that have been pre-defined.

`Input Field`: An input field is used for storing text inputs. The input field can only accept a limited number of text inputs.

`Text Box`: Similar to the input field, a text box is also used for storing text inputs. The text box usually accepts a larger amount of text inputs than the input field.

`Date Picker`: A date picker is a popup calender that allows the user to select a specific date.

`Modal`: A modal is an element that display in front of the page and deactivates other page content unless a specific action is made (e.g. Clicking OK, Filling out a form, Clicking Cancel)

`Image`: The image component lets the user insert an image inside the canvas

`Table`: The table component lets the user insert a table inside the canvas with a specific number of rows and columns.

`Iframe`: An Iframe is a component that can be embedded inside the canvas and is often used to insert content.
